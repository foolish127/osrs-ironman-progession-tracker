# Ideas

The Vision:
- I'd like to have an overall dashboard. It would be like a visual progression bar/chart for your overall account. Maybe there'd be a setting page where you add in/exclude content. E.g. I don't want to PvP or do Inferno.
- The dashboard would be broken down into various areas like collection logs, boss kc, gear collected, etc.
- It would have some sort of snapshot feature where it could track account progression over time, e.g. daily, weekly, monthly, annually. Maybe it would provide some sort of summary of this as requested.
